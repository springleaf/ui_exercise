# UI Exercise
A UI exercise for UI applicants at OneMain

Use the design files in this repository to build a simple form, similar to one you might encounter working for us. Please match the design as closely as you are able.

- Assume the form submits to a secure backend.
- All fields are required, though the form changes depending on if you are planing to use a debit card or bank account.
- Account, routing, and credit card numbers, as well as CVV, should be numbers only.
- CVV should be exactly 3 numbers.
- Routing number should be no more than 9 numbers.

Get as close to the design as you can using whatever libraries/frameworks you’re most comfortable with.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Try not to spend more than a few hours on this, but feel free space it out over a couple of days. We know a work/life balance is important and exercises like this just add on to that.

We’re just looking for a simple front-end only implementation of this.  Assume that the actual form submits to a secure backend. The only validations we’re looking for are the ones spelled out in the description.

Your response should be a folder containing any HTML, CSS, and JS you’ve written.  We should be able to just open the index file to view the exercise.

Feel free to return the folder as a zip file or upload it to your GitHub. Either way, please let me know when you’ve completed the exercise so that we can evaluate your work.

### What we're looking for
- How close did you get to the design?
- Do all of the validations work?
- Is the user experience simple and intuative?
- is the code clean and readable?

If you have any additional questions or need assistance, please reach out as soon as possible.
