# UI Exercise
A UI exercise for UI applicants at OneMain

Use the design files in this repository to build a simple form, similar to one you might encounter working for us. Please match the design as closely as you are able.

- Assume the form submits to a secure backend.
- All fields are required, though the form changes depending on if you are planing to use a debit card or bank account.
- Account, routing, and credit card numbers, as well as CVV, should be numbers only.
- CVV should be exactly 3 numbers.
- Routing number should be no more than 9 numbers.

Get as close to the design as you can using whatever libraries/frameworks you’re most comfortable with.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Try not to spend more than a few hours on this, but feel free space it out over a couple of days. We know a work/life balance is important and exercises like this just add on to that.

We’re just looking for a simple front-end only implementation of this.  Assume that the actual form submits to a secure backend. The only validations we’re looking for are the ones spelled out in the description.

Your response should be a folder containing any HTML, CSS, and JS you’ve written.  We should be able to just open the index file to view the exercise.

Please upload the project folder to your GitHub for our review. Either way, please let me know when you’ve completed the exercise so that we can evaluate your work.

### What we're looking for
- How close did you get to the design?
- Do all of the validations work?
- Is the user experience simple and intuative?
- is the code clean and readable?

If you have any additional questions or need assistance, please reach out as soon as possible.
